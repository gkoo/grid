Grid
====

Another experiment with NodeJS and its real-time application capabilities. This project provides a very basic interface for collaborative drawing. It provides a grid which the user can draw on by dragging their mouse across it. Multiple users can draw on the grid at the same time and the results will show on each other's screens.

This was one of my first NodeJS projects back in the winter of 2010.
